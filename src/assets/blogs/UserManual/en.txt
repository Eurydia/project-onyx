# User Manual

**Quick guide**: 
1. Enter a Boolean expression into the input field
1. Press "RUN"
1. Click on a node to modify the truth values

## Supported Logical Connectives

The application supports the following logical keywords and their respective mathematical symbols:

- Logical negation    (keyword: `not`     , symbol: &not;) 
- Logical conjunction (keyword: `and`     , symbol: &and;) 
- Logical disjunction (keyword: `or`      , symbol: &or;) 
- Logical implication (keyword: `implies` , symbol: &rArr;) 
- Logical equivalence (keyword: `iff`     , symbol: &iff;)

The keyword and the symbol are considered the same, so can use them interchangebly, or evening mix them in an expression.

You can use the ribbon to insert a symbol into the input. With the input area active, press `CTRL` and `ENTER` to evaluate the expression

## Features 

**Evaluation playback**

Use the playback control to see order of evaluation for the expression. Press forward or rewind to a finer playback control and the slider to quickly move around the evaluation.

**Testing different truth values**

Propositions are false initially. 

To modify the truth value of a proposition, press one of the node present in the output area.

Doing so will open up a window. In this window, you can modify the truth values of propositions present in the particular sub expression. Pressing the root will show the entire tree, along with every proposition.
