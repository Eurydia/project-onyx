# Project Onyx

An interpreter and visualizer for Boolean algebra.

## Overview

The application takes an Boolean expression and evaluates its truth value by substituting given values. The application displays the result of the evaluation using an interactive syntax tree.

## Technologies and Libraries

- **React**
- **KaTeX**: for rendering mathematical expressions, although it is mostly included for aesthethic.
- **visx**: for the interactive graph, which includes the node positioning along with zooming and panning.
- **MUIv6**: for the UI components.
- **react-markdown**: for conversion from MD files content to blog posts and large text content in the application.
