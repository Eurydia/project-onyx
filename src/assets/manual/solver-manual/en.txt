# User Manual

## Quick start

First, enter a Boolean expression into the input field. Then, evaluate the expression by pressing the RUN button. Try it with this expression:

$$
\text{not (p and q) iff (not p) or (not q)}
$$

You should see the result of the evalutation which includes; a step-by-step evaluation, and a truth table.

## More on the expressions

Only propositional logic expressions are supported, so this section will cover propositions and logical connectives.

A proposition is denoted by lowercase or uppercase Latin alphabets, but a proposition cannot contain any other symbols.

For example,

$$
\text{$p$, $q$, $a$, $b$, $P$, $Q$, $Pq$}
$$

are all valid names for a proposition, but 

$$
\text{$a1$, $b\_3$, $p!$, $a*$}
$$

are not recognized by the application, as such, it is important to use valid names for propositions. Otherwise, the application will not evaluate the given expression.
  
There are five supported operators;

**Negation** *(symbol: $\lnot$, textual: `not`)*

$$
\begin{align*}
&\lnot P\\
&\text{not $P$}
\end{align*}
$$

**Conjunction** *(symbol: $\land$, textual: `and`)*

$$
\begin{align*}
&P\land Q\\
&\text{$P$ and $Q$}
\end{align*}
$$

**Disjunction** *(symbol: $\lor$, textual: `or`)*

$$
\begin{align*}
&P\lor Q\\
&\text{$P$ or $Q$}
\end{align*}
$$

**Implication** *(symbol: $\implies$, textual: `implies`)*

$$
\begin{align*}
&P\implies Q\\
&\text{$P$ implies $Q$}
\end{align*}
$$

**Equivalence** *(symbol: $\iff$, textual: `iff`)*

$$
\begin{align*}
&P\iff Q\\
&\text{$P$ iff $Q$}
\end{align*}
$$

For better ergonomics, it is recommended to use the textual representation of each connective rather than its symbolic representation even though they are interchangeable. Alternatively, you can quickly insert a symbol using the toolbar provided above the input field.
