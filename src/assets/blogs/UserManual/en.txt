To use the interpreter, simply type in a Boolean expresion into the input field and press run! If you expression is well-formed, you should see a version of your expression the interpreter sees, but if you see nothing, you might want to double check your expression.

You can also play around with the truth value of your expression by changing the truth values of your propositions.

While you are here, let me tell you a few tips. You can press `CTRL` + `ENTER` to trigger the run button. The math symbols can be tricky to write, so you can use the following; 



- *and* is an alias for &and;, 
- *or* is an alias for &or;, 
- *implies* is an alias for &rarr;, 
- *iff* is an alias for &hArr;, and 
- *not* is an alias for &not;. 

Beware since these are case-sensitive. For example, you can write an expresion like this; `not (p and q) iff not p or not q`.
